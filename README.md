A comprehensive console-based calculator application written in C++ that provides essential mathematical operations with an intuitive user interface.

## üåü Features

This Smart Calculator offers four fundamental mathematical operations:

### üî¢ Exponentiation
- Calculate the power of any number using efficient loop-based implementation
- Custom algorithm for power calculation without using built-in functions

### üîç Even/Odd Number Detection
- Analyze up to 4 numbers simultaneously
- Instant classification of numbers as even or odd
- Batch processing for multiple numbers

### üìä Average Calculator
- Calculate the arithmetic mean of 4 numbers
- Supports decimal numbers with high precision
- Real-time calculation and display

### üßÆ Factorial Calculator
- Compute factorial of any positive integer
- Loop-based implementation for educational purposes
- Clear step-by-step calculation display

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Windows/Linux/macOS operating system
- Basic command line knowledge

### Installation & Compilation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amr4924/Simple-Cpp-Operations-Project.git
   cd Simple-Cpp-Operations-Project
   ```

2. **Compile the program:**
   
   **For Windows (MinGW/MSYS2):**
   ```bash
   g++ -fdiagnostics-color=always -g "Simple Operations.cpp" -o "Simple Operations.exe"
   ```
   
   **For Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   g++ "Simple Operations.cpp" -o "Simple_Operations"
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   .\Simple Operations.exe
   ```
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   ./Simple_Operations
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Launch the application** - The Smart Calculator welcome screen will appear
2. **Select an operation** - Choose from 4 available mathematical operations:
   - Press `1` for Exponentiation
   - Press `2` for Even/Odd Check
   - Press `3` for Average Calculation
   - Press `4` for Factorial Calculation
3. **Follow the prompts** - Enter the required numbers based on your selection
4. **View results** - The calculator will display the computed results
5. **Continue or exit** - Choose to perform another operation or exit the program

### Example Usage

```
=====================================
     Smart Calculator Installed!     
=====================================

[1] The first operation is the process of calculating the exponent.
[2] The second operation is the process of checking if the numbers are even or odd.
[3] The third operation is the process of calculating the average of four numbers.
[4] The fourth operation is the process of calculating the factorial of a number.

Enter Number (1) Or (2) Or (3) Or (4): 1
You have chosen the exponentiation operation.
Enter the number and power.
Enter a number: 5
Enter the number of times to square it: 3
The square: 125
